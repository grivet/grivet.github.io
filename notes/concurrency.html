<h2>Structure properties</h2>
<p><strong>Lock-freedom</strong>: A data structure is lock-free iff <em>some</em> operation on the
structure completes after a finite number of steps have been executed system-wide.</p>
<p><strong>Wait-freedom</strong>: A data structure is wait-free iff <em>every</em> operation on the
structure completes after a finite number of steps. Livelock is impossible and worst-case
execution is known for every operation.</p>
<p><strong>Obstruction-freedom</strong>: A data structure is obstruction-free iff <em>every</em> operation
on the structure completes after executing a finite number of steps that do not contend with
any concurrent operation for access to any memory location.</p>
<h2>Operation properties</h2>
<p><strong>Disjoint-access parallelism</strong>: A set of operations are disjoint-access parallel iff
any pair of operation invocations which access disjoint sets of memory locations do not directly
affect each others' execution.</p>
<p><strong>Linearizability</strong>: If an operation is implemented as a synchronous procedure, a call to that procedure
is an invocation and the eventual return from that procedure is a response. An operation is linearizable iff
it <em>appears</em> to execute instantaneously at some point between its invocation and its response.</p>
<p><strong>Serializability</strong>: A series of operation is serializable iff invocations and responses can be reordered to yield
a sequential history, and such history would be compatible with each operation precedence. This is less strict than
linearizability, because such compatible reordering can exist without instantaneous operations.</p>

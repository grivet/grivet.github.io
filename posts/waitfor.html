<p>A recurring pattern in my workflow has been to reboot a machine and wait for its
networking to be enabled. One issue here is that the latency until completion falls squarely within
&quot;too short to do something else, too long to stare at my screen&quot;. Instead, a shell function allows
chaining a connection event with my desktop notification bus (or, well, you know, <em>anything</em>).
The full check is for a <code>TCP</code> connection to be possible on a port, as usually access is through <code>SSH</code>.</p>
<pre><code># Run $@ until it succeeds, but allow SIGINT to cancel.
_cancellable_until () {(
    cancel=&quot;false&quot;
    until &quot;$@&quot; &gt; /dev/null; do :; done &amp;
    trap 'kill $!; cancel=&quot;true&quot;' INT
    wait $!
    trap - INT
    if [ $cancel = &quot;true&quot; ]; then
        return 1
    fi
)}

# ping $1 until it is up and port ${2:-22} is open.
waitfor () {
    port=${2:-22}
    _cancellable_until ping -W1 -c1 &quot;$1&quot; || return 1
    echo &quot;Ping ok.&quot;
    _cancellable_until nc -w 1 -z &quot;$1&quot; &quot;${port}&quot; || return 1
    echo &quot;Port ${port} is open.&quot;
}

# Usage:
$ waitfor srv0 2223 &amp;&amp; notify-send &quot;Host 'srv0' is ready.&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>At the surface level, the requirements are simple: wide portability and short list
of dependencies. It should be something easy to copy into limited shells,
so POSIX is enforced using <a href="https://www.shellcheck.net/">shellcheck</a>.
It also relies on <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/ping">ping</a> and <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc">netcat</a>
being available. I preferred netcat to alternatives such as <code>/dev/tcp</code>
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html">bash extension</a> as perharps surprisingly I found netcat
more prevalent than bash on those embedded targets. Similarly, <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/socat">socat</a> is
more useful and I might have it already on most hosts, but if socat is available then so is netcat usually.</p>
<p>The end result is more complex than I would have liked. The much simpler naive version could be written
as such:</p>
<pre><code>waitfor () {
    port=${2:-22}
    until ping -W1 -c1 &quot;$1&quot;; do :; done
    echo &quot;Ping ok.&quot;
    until nc -w 1 -z &quot;$1&quot; &quot;${port}&quot; do :; done
    echo &quot;Port ${port} is open.&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>My issue with it is that interrupting the function does not work well. Usually only the inner
function (ping or netcat) is interrupted, but not the loop. Thus spamming <code>SIGINT</code> becomes necessary
to stop the check.</p>
<p>The solution to this is easier when the inner function is expected to succeed usually in an endless loop.
In this case the halting condition for the loop is any success of the inner function, while usual failure means
retrying. Receiving a <code>SIGINT</code> should be considered a specific failure and return a code of <code>128 + SIGINT</code>,
so 130. Checking the return value of ping however, it does not conform to this spec.</p>
<p>Instead, the inner function is put in the background and <code>SIGINT</code> is trapped. To avoid unsightly prints related
to background jobs launch and end, the loop itself is launched within a subshell.</p>

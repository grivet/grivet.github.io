        <h1>shell: cleaner cancellable until</h1>

<p>A recurring pattern in my workflow has been to reboot a machine and then wait for SSH access
to be available. One issue is that the latency until completion falls squarely within
&quot;too short to do something else, too long to stare at my screen&quot;.</p>
<p>To avoid getting distracted and having another context switch, I wrote a short shell function:</p>
<pre><code>waitfor () {
    port=${2:-22}
    until ping -W1 -c1 &quot;$1&quot;; do :; done
    echo &quot;Ping ok.&quot;
    until nc -w 1 -z &quot;$1&quot; &quot;${port}&quot;; do :; done
    echo &quot;Port ${port} is open.&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Which can be used to chain the discovery of the open port with e.g. a notification:</p>
<pre><code># Usage:
$ waitfor srv0 2223 &amp;&amp; notify-send &quot;Host 'srv0' is ready.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>So far so good. The function is simple and requires minimal dependencies: POSIX shell, <code>ping</code> and
<code>netcat</code> available. Ping could be removed if ICMP is blocked and TCP access is all that matters,
but it is not the case usually for me.</p>
<p>The issue with this implementation however is a slightly messy behavior that would grate me
anytime I would use it and then cancel. Sending <code>SIGINT</code> to the shell, either <code>ping</code> or <code>netcat</code>
will receive it, or the shell itself executing <code>until</code>. If the former, as the loop is written
to expect failure and stop only on success, it would continue ; cue spamming C-C to stop.</p>
<p>Not a big issue for sure, but I wanted to know how it could be fixed, preferrably keeping it
entirely POSIX. In the end I came up with the following:</p>
<pre><code># Run $@ until it succeeds, but allow SIGINT to cancel.
_cancellable_until () {(
    cancel=&quot;false&quot;
    until &quot;$@&quot; &gt; /dev/null; do :; done &amp;
    trap 'kill $!; cancel=&quot;true&quot;' INT
    wait $!
    trap - INT
    if [ $cancel = &quot;true&quot; ]; then
        return 1
    fi
)}

# ping $1 until it is up and port ${2:-22} is open.
waitfor () {
    port=${2:-22}
    _cancellable_until ping -W1 -c1 &quot;$1&quot; || return 1
    echo &quot;Ping ok.&quot;
    _cancellable_until nc -w 1 -z &quot;$1&quot; &quot;${port}&quot; || return 1
    echo &quot;Port ${port} is open.&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>First thing to note: the loop body is empty, so this is not iso-functional with the actual
<code>until</code> loop of course. Adding a separate body was of no use to me and I preferred to avoid the complexity.</p>
<p>The actual loop is executed as a background job. Immediately after starting it, <code>SIGINT</code>
is trapped in the current shell, to send the default <code>SIGTERM</code> to the last job when received.
The current shell will then wait for the job to complete: either the command in parameter (&quot;<code>$@</code>&quot;)
finally succeeds or <code>SIGINT</code> is issued.</p>
<p>If <code>SIGINT</code> is received, the cancellation will make the function return a non-zero exit value, allowing
the caller to be aware of it, and stop immediately.</p>
<p>Additionally, the whole <code>_cancellable_until</code> is executed in another subshell
(started by the <code>()</code> within the function <code>{}</code>), which will avoid printing the job logs, to reduce visual
noise.</p>
<p>The intended behavior is achieved, but at what cost! All of this to have a clean failure loop
cancellation. Maybe more advanced shells could have better primitives, but making <code>waitfor</code> portable
and clean was more complex than it should have been.</p>
